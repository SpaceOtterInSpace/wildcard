<?php
// A Population of Fish

// There is a population of fish numbering 10,000 at the start of the year.
// Every month 5% of the fish alive at the start of the month, excluding offspring,
// die during the month.
// For the months of May/June/July 25% of the fish alive at the start of the month
// pair off and pro-create. Each pair have 3 off-spring.
// Every month, 15% of newly born fish over 3 months old depart the colony.

// Assumptions:
// Off spring do not pro-create
// Make any other assumptions you need if you are in doubt.
// Write code to calculate the number of fish at the end of the year

// Notes:
// Please write the code as plain PHP, it should not be object oriented, and you
// should write it so it can be easily understood.
